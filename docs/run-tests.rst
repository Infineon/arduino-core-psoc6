Running Hardware Tests
=========================

This document provides instructions on running tests on hardware using the Unity framework. These tests call the 
Arduino APIs to execute and verify functionality.

Test Environment Setup
-----------------------

.. note::
   | The development environment setup is (currently) only supported on **Linux** |:penguin:|. 
   | As many tools and scripts are not cross-platform, some of them will not directly work on Windows |:abcd:| or macOS |:apple:|.

.. important::
   | To successfully run the tests, ensure that your development environment is properly configured.
   | See the section on :ref:`Environment Setup <env-setup>`.

Board Setup
-------------

1. Connect your PSOCâ„¢ 6 board (e.g. CY8CKIT-062S2-AI) to your computer |:computer:| via USB.

2. Make the board-to-board pin connections as described below:

   CY8CKIT-062S2-AI:

      .. include:: ../tests/cy8ckit-062s2-ai-hil-test-table.md
         :parser: myst_parser.sphinx_

Executing Test Cases Using `make`
---------------------------------

The Makefile relies on arduino-cli for compiling, uploading, and monitoring. Unity is included as a library.

1. Change directories:

   ::

      cd tests/arduino-core-tests

2. Use the `make` command to run a specific test. For example, to run a digital I/O test:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make FQBN= `FQBN` PORT= `PORT` test_digitalio_single monitor

   - `FQBN`: select the connected board (e.g., `infineon:psoc6:cy8ckit_062s2_a`).
   - `PORT`: set the appropriate serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`).
   - monitor : opens the serial monitor to view the test results.


3. Display usage information about the available make targets:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      make help

4. Start testing other features |:tools:| !
